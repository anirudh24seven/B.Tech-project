RT @diogeneb: Generally, cancer may return after UV treatment. In this case, Yuvi returns after cancer treatment. Welcome back Yuvi.
The discussions pertained to opening of quarters gate, firing the then director, creating more deans etc. :|
Read one of the meetings of BoG of NITT back in Oct 2010. speaks 0 abt students or any of the activities related to them. was bad back then.
RT @kelkulus: In quantum mechanics, a principle states that a man can use his brain, or stare at a pair of breasts, but cannot do both at the same time.
RT @Gulopine: imagine if we wrote resumes the way recruiters send emails: "Stealth-mode Software Engineer with no visible history seeks Rockstar Employer"
@ashpr0 Yess, will understand :( Anyway, this sem only vetti. Prev sem and all they were killing us with classes..

Half of the blogs will be empty, if we can come up with a separate website, just explaining how-to-use a sw or how-to-install a sw.
RT @RobHarris: Wenger on Man United's title charge: "When a horse smells his stable, it is difficult to stop them"
Ha ha ha!! RT @BigRed_M: Hargo was taunting them from the moment he joined. http://t.co/PZ1BCakc
@msnarun worth ah? .. adha sollu :) Will you be happy to see him at Arsenal?
Kompany zimply wants to show his abs ah? .. Ok.
Never felt so good after arsenal win :)
Somebody just got a life-line!! I mean it!!
@msnarun @Satish_NR He shouldn't have bought him only :P
ha ha ha!! Mancini asks him to come off fast! :D :D
Somebody gonna score, somebody gonna die :)
@prakaashk agreed.
Its all down to liverpool blood.
Now this is only conspiracy..
@prakaashk Yes, no doubt about that. Utd if they win this season, one aspect is purely down to scholes return.
@prakaashk He has his downs agreed. He is better than anderson and few others at least. We spoke highly of Cleverly, he was shite today.
No other team comes close to that wing change pass :-) Rooney is god at that :)
@prakaashk Don't completely agree with that. He has just arrived, and has done okay. But yea, totally agree he should be reprimanded.
@prakaashk Nothing new at Utd. we have seen ROnaldo, Nani all do that.
@nbprashanth @vivek_hari exactly my feelings :)
@YaavanoObba 'Mo' because, 'on' would sound optimistic. :P
@machiviga One guy says, bad guys will cut hands if he goes against him. Then he says, avan 6inch cut panna, namba 12inch cut pannalam.
@machiviga think thennavan. not sure, just started watching.
@machiviga Yes yes :) Watteman da he is :D
The depth to which a person can cut a blade is directly proportional to his moral code of conduct. #ktv #gap10
If there is something people hate more than United, then it should surely be City, cause even United fans hate them :) #mufc
Dear balotelli.. You are supposed to fall down when the game is in progress..
@Satish_NR Then okay :P
When is silva returning for city??
What skill Hart :) Brilliant first touch.
Ha ha ha ha ha...
RT @Eboue_Eboue: Another shocking knee-high challenge by Balotelli ...this time on the post
@msnarun No logic in that da... Then each team can buy.
Song! One giant!
@msnarun That is the point no? The larger picture is winning the league!
See, if utd had referees, we would have paid them to give fouls for arsenal also. There goes your logic.
Hell!! :(
Otha! Must definitely appreciate the arsenal fans at emirates. That is some awesome noise :)
RT @rioferdy5: Players feigning injuries or players that go down & act like they have been hit by a lorry etc do my head in massively. Punish them too??
RT @Satish_NR: Ya ya.. Hes gone :-P >> for a tour-eh?? :P
Utd fans on my TL are live-tweeting the arsenal game.. LOL
@SathyaNaryanan seri vidu.. Idha discussion, wing le continue pannuvom.
@prakaashk No no.. yaya fell down for a foul.
@SathyaNaryanan Why does cricket have huge following? No goals, no offsides, no freekicks, no yellow cards, no red cards, no passing,
Balotelli got ball, sat down, ate one mini meals, got up, took ball, and gave it to opponent.
Mancini itself cant believe it :P
RT @Jagajaljeera: @azaxacavabanama @madraslover on why supporting manutd does not make sense for ppl in tamilnadu http://t.co/eVrCTbXJ #blog
RT @BlueMoonRubbish: Disgrace to the sport that all 20 teams should be but aren't treated fairly. There's a reason they have the devil as their symbol...
2nd min booking. Nice :)
Gap10 on ktv, arsenal manc match or project.. Hmmm.. One option will surely be eliminated.
@Satish_NR See.. You did it again!! OMG!! :D Watteman!!
RT @badgerwolf: We won. That is all #MUFC
@Satish_NR You are on Fire!!! :) *ok that didn't come out well, but meant it*
RT @Satish_NR: @viveksundarm oaf means a clumsy idiot.. Somewat like @ashwinjagadeesh
RT @Satish_NR: Dada gone.. Now @msnarun wil watch arsenal match peacefully :p
@SathyaNaryanan Free ya udu.. Non-sync ah vanduthu..
@SathyaNaryanan Somebody kept hand ..
Bad boy rafael :P
Rocket!!! :)
Brilliance!!! Scholesy!!!
Great.. Giggs Corner :)
Did someone catch that expression?? Surely, troll football will have a field day :D
Good.. :) Giggs is on.. Now bring chicha.
Now looks like United DONT want to score.. :|
Scholesy was deivam there :)
Need one extra player near that Valencia Rafael wing. Both are doing wonders, but, need to pump it there.
@prk2help I am not joining that.. poda..
United are doing farmer's market in front of the D box.
@prk2help You have one whatsapp group also va.. Velangidum..
Welbeck missed it there :|
@prk2help aprom?? :P dei dei.. avlo muttal illa na.. :) seri udu.. Me going to watch match.
@prk2help Ippudi tweet pannalam, nadakathu di.. :P
@prk2help We have got many raw decisions this season da. And he comes out, one odd game, and he says that. ngothadei..
@msnarun Fuck you da. Fuck you for saying that. FUck all the bastards if they ever say that.
Mason forgot the difference between off-side and sending-off!!!
Govt. decides to open strip clubs, in a bid to control raping menace. Quota will be there, and BPL will get discounts. #fakingnews
Unless we get another goal, I don't think, we should celebrate this win.
QPR have only one 'goal' - Defending theirs.
Can referee be sent off in a game??
#MasonForCityGame!!!
Webb's aavi has gone into Mason.
Undeserved.. But no complaints :)
Cha cha.. Pity..
RT @avenkat10: COME ON UNITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@machiviga Thats what I also hope :)
This ashok menaria guy looks scarily like Yuvi..
@machiviga Machi, neeyum ovvuru match yum tweet pannara.. :-) aana, avan ennamo oru goal dan adikaran.. :P
