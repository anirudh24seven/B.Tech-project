@Wakeup_Sukh great chance of RR winning if they bat first.
Now Yuvi's battle is to move from NED (No evidence of Decease) to END (evidence of no decease). Praying that he reaches there soon.
@TeJanTheWall Steyn is a top bowler...one of the best World has ever seen.
@Wakeup_Sukh thanks :)
@TeJanTheWall thanks :) we did play some cricket together.

As I prepare to listen to Yuvi's press conf. Arthur Ashe's words come to my mind after being diagnosed with AIDS. He said -- Cont.
@Sumairriyaz And why would u say that?
So far the highlight of the IPL has been quality fast bowling. Steyn, Morkel, Malinga, Lee...these guys are worth their weight in gold.
Makes me happy to see that Bisla (who's also a dear friend) is proving me wrong :) Brilliant.
Brilliant start by KKR...would've preferred someone else (Tiwary/Doeschate/Yusuf) at Number 3. Sincerely hope Bisla proves me wrong.

Off to RK Studios for Extra Innings T20...Will Sachin's absence give Deccan an outside chance or will it be a one-sided affair?? #IPL5
@samirkochhar oh yes...it's good to be back :) catch up with u on my next visit.

As I land in Mumbai I get to know that my friend @samirkochhar has reached Bangalore. Would've loved to catch up. Perhaps, next time!!
@RajeevRRC hope the next game isn't against KingsXI or DC.
@rokul88 ya, too many openers in the side.
Off to Mumbai for a couple of days. Will be on Extra Innings T20...looking forward to be in RK Studios.
Since a lot of you have asked about KKR...I think that they'll bounce back. McCullum, Kallis, Gauti, Yusuf too good to fail for too long.
Deccan & Kings are threatening to take the unpredictability of T20 cricket out of this year's IPL. Hope that it doesn't happen.
Isn't there a case to start playing two Bangladesh cricketers--Shakib and Tamim?? KKR shall do it in d next game and PWI may do it tonight!
Game, Set and Match.
McCullum has gotten out Leg Before to a left-arm spinner twice in two matches...almost identical deliveries.
Brilliant wicket to bat and hence 164 is an in-between score. Need to bowl well...how about opening the bowling with Ankit Chavan?
@karnmamgain Thanks :)

@Iamtenalirama True...but not so exciting for fans, no!
@Ganesh_205 Money :)
As @knittins rightly points out...Kings may give them stiff competition.
Said it in our (CNN IBN) preview of the IPL, reiterating again...Deccan are most likely to become the whipping boys of the IPL.
@aarkay123 Correct. Hasn't lived up to the promise
RT @sardesairajdeep: The day the fans cry when their team loses and not just the franchise owners, IPL can truly celebrate! Gnight
@ravsdh @CricketSaurabh Ha ha :)
@CricketSaurabh They can surely do with a spinner...
@Stats_GuruG Because Windies mostly plays in two other formats
@knightviru PWI can't play 5 overseas...
@iamArunnath Sure...it is :) Said it even before the IPL began
Is Amit Mishra fit? If he is then why isn't he in the XI? He's one of the few good Indian players Deccan has.
@jsvasan We did on CNN IBN in our show at 7.30pm
@jsvasan I meant RCB.
@jsvasan Not sure about it.
@DeewanSaab Agree
Some of our umpires can give correct LBW decision even on the move...
@sachin434 Did u watch the game? Umesh injured.
Difference between being in-form and out-of-form. Find the gaps when in-form, find the fielders when out of it. #sehwag
@shuklajr Still going with DD
@Abhiontwtr Proving a point as the leader of a winning team and I'm also expecting him to bat with more responsibility
@iamArunnath Yes, a mediocre TEST team. Where r the bowlers? Only Herath...no fast bowlers!
@Abhiontwtr Everything isn't about India captaincy, right! He's doing well and hence applauded. Simple :)
@Abhiontwtr They haven't won this game yet, no??
I'm quite liking Viru's captaincy...pro-active and not taking the foot off the pedal at all. Out there to prove a point or two??
@piyushshukla17 No idea, bro!
Empower the third-umpire pls...if the idea is to eliminate howlers, allow him to intervene and assist the on-field umpire.

@sidvee Thanks a lot :) Look forward to your views on OOTB. Would u, by any chance, know any curators in Texas/Dallas region?
@knightviru We did. :) The ones who follow domestic cricket knew about his a long time before that.
@sidvee Not at all. :) btw which part of the states are you in? AND have you finished reading my books?

@manakgupta Insatiable hunger for runs...needs to tie a few loose ends but a seriously good batsman. How've u been?
@skumarkasot RR
The more I see of Rahane, the more I wonder how he isn't playing for India right now?? Should have played in Australia and Asia Cup.
@nbanerji Also, I'd be very happy if he does.
@nbanerji Okay. Let's agree to disagree. And wait for him to make a mark at the International level...that's the real test, no!
What a shot, Rahane. Best of the lot :)
@nbanerji I'm not against him bt I don't appreciate ur pointing out things after a performance or 2. Also attributing stuff that I dint say!
Here's something I wrote about the IPL in a lighter vein http://t.co/JpnQ5m60 Your thoughts pls :)
@BociwhPG Nopes
@nbanerji I don't recall that tweet...would appreciate if you dig it up.
@nbanerji Didn't see u tweeting about him during the Asia Cup? C'mon, bro...chill. Ppl r entitled to their opinions.
@nbanerji Really? U know a lot more about me that I do. But IMHO Dinda isn't the best in the country.
@nbanerji Read my blog on Yahoo! I didn't laugh, I wrote.
Marlon Samuels and Bhuvnesh Kumar generating same pace...poor Kumar must be wondering at the futility of his 15 yards long run-up!
It would be great fun to watch PWI play against KKR in Kolkata. Not for the Sourav connection but for the surface @ Eden. Spinners paradise!
Stumbled upon this one... http://t.co/0IwwDXht
@vrthejas Appreciate that :)
Gilchrist said on CNN IBN that IPL is no longer a level playing field. It's increasingly becomin a league of Haves and Have-Nots. You agree?
As expected both Munaf and Suryakumar Yadav playing in place of Nechim and injured Sachin. Interesting choice of players from PWI.
@jsvasan what exactly do u want to hear??
I expect either Munaf or RP to play in place of Nechim and Suryakumar Yadav gets a game if Sachin isn't fit. #MIvPWI
DRS in the current form is turning out to be a JOKE. ICC needs to wake up and tie the loose ends, for there are way too many right now!
