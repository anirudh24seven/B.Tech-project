@NeeleshKumar93 @rajpgovind I'm not gng to argue. If u don't like ppl, unfollow, block etc.
Contests for tonight--Morkel v Levi, Malinga v Sehwag, Bhajji/Ojha v KP/Mahela. Should be an interesting game. #ipl5
@rajpgovind let people air their views. Never tell anyone to stop. If u don't like it, stop following them.
Wondering what kinda surface MI will dish out...turner could be the best choice against DD. But will they punt after what Pune did to them?

@JohnnyBuoooy http://t.co/1cH5zSBW Hope this works
@nad131 I totally agree that it needs a revamp but to deride it is not acceptable.
@pols314 I know but Indian market is a little different...books priced over 300 don't reach out to many!
@pols314 No..increases the price. But yes, pictures haven't come out nice.
@pols314 Thanks :)

@Sanjay_Dixit what exactly did Sherry say??
@Hemu_vuha nopes.
@RainaFanClub I keep talking abt that but people who matter don't seem to pay heed.
I rarely use IPL performances and selection in the Indian team in the same sentence but Rahane forced me to do that. Well played, mate!
Today two heavyweights lost to two lesser fancied teams...just the shot in the arm this tournament needed. #IPL5

@CricCrazyNIKS :)
Tough to choose between the wide array of strokes Rahane displayed but the one he played over the covers fielder off Murali was special.
Absolutely delighted to see the authority with which  Rahane batted and also the way Pankaj bowled so far. Happy for both of them.
@gauravCNNIBN Absolutely...
Gilly seemed to have forgotten that Bipul Sharma is there too...why wouldn't u bowl a left-arm spinner on this surface??
@K__Sharma He's been brilliant. Sonnet was outstanding too...great institue. always made me punch above my weight
@K__Sharma Yes...9 yrs old.
RT @gauravCNNIBN: we have a former knight in @cricketaakash available at 7:30pm to look back on this game- also joined by @shishhattangadi
@K__Sharma I'm who I am because of him...taught me everything from holding the bat to taking a catch.
@venkatananth @rr2303 Rahane is good...can't say the same about Chand. Did nothing in Ranji this season.
@venkatananth @RR2303 Who are we talking about?
In spite of losing all 3 league matches, India Under-19 wins the quadrangular tournament. What an absurd format that allows this to happen?
While this kind of pitch seems to be working for KKR at the moment, they may get caught in their own web against MI, Chennai n Pune.
Gaurav Kalra's Blog-Relish the sport beyond the format: Cricketnext http://t.co/KwIyIgRU Good one...have a read!
@greyblazerr That's true...it may change their mindset completely. The best example is Umar Gul...brilliant in ODIs n T20s...poor in Tests
@greyblazerr Thanks :) I hope that they don't...in fact they won't if they keep playing the other two formats.

@DolphinBay4 @S_Ram13 You got to be a little objective while being emotional. Nobody criticizes/praises someone without a reason.
@S_Ram13 What do u want to hear? Something about his batting, fielding, running between the wickets or captaincy?? :)
Play horses for courses...since the course is a turning pitch at Eden, only wise to rest the seam-up bowlers for tweakers. #kxipvkkr #ipl5
They say that don't change d winning combination but if I was Gilchrist, I would. Bolster d spin department & find a bigger role for Hussey
Can't understand the reluctance to bowl a left arm spinner to a southpaw...don't off-spinners bowl to right-handers all the time??
@PawanSamotra I'd have a Subway :) just kidding...CSK.
@PawanSamotra In my pocket :)
@CricketSaurabh That's a no brainer ;)
Expecting Tamim Iqbal to replace Ryder & Kartik to come in for Pandey. Not expecting any changes for Chennai. Let's see if I get it right :)
@shishhattangadi @Sanjay_Dixit That's true too!
CSK v PWI. India's two finest captains against each other...but will it be about their leadership or skills with the bat?
Great field placement...who keeps a deep extra cover on the fence to a part-timer...well done, Jam.
Decent total on this surface...lots of spin and RR has lots of spinners to exploit the conditions. Gambhir & Pathan hold the key.

@CricketSaurabh @ZENIADCUNHA Be honest, Saurabh :) Say it that you did it because of a certain bladewallah ;)
I know that Gayle wasn't there...but I would have bowled Vinay in the 19th. It's easier to hit 28 in d 19th than 20 in the final over.
@sumanta48 VINAY. Easier to hit 28 in the 19th than hitting 20 in the last over...
A few tactical bloopers today--Best bowler Bollinger bowled only 3 overs, part-timer Kohli bowled d 19th & Pandey batted at #8.

@adityaguharoy Turning, for they were outstanding in previous matches. Both on turning pitches.
We found out two things today--RCB may struggle to defend big scores and PWI is a different side on turning pitches.
Expect a close match...
@Sriram_Lakshman Keep writing there too...twice a month!
@aamod_desai True
@ashwinkumar50 Should be enough
@Sriram_Lakshman I'm not a blind supporter...far from it. Have written extensively about the ills...but everything isn't wrong about anythin
There seems to be enough in the track for quick bowlers...will get to know more after Dinda, Nehra and Mathews bowl.

We shall get to know about it soon. RT @CricketSaurabh: @cricketaakash If Gayle is smart he would have changed his number by now.
Contest to look forward to--Ashwin bowling to Gayle. Will be interesting to know if Ashwin still has Gayle's number from last year :)
Australia winning the Test match, once again, proves that in order to create an opportunity for a victory you must not fear losing. Kudos!
I said 'unknown' because when two men (Pollard & Shah) produced sterling performances, people tend to forget the supporting actors on d day!
RR went down but not without a serious fight. Shows the character of the team. Rahane n Rayudu were the two unknown stars of the day!
RT @gauravCNNIBN: 11:30pm- @bhogleharsha @cricketaakash & @shishhattangadi look back on mumbai indians vs rajasthan royals..plenty to talk about!

@buddy__7 Mumbai
The contest I'm looking forward to see is between Rahane and Malinga. Will get to know a bit more about Rahane's batting.
MI or RR? Mumbai may be a stronger side on paper but rule out Dravid's Royals at ur own peril. RR favorites if they bat first.
@CriticMayBe Not really...read a lot about cancer. The battle is always for the END.
